initElements(): initElements is a static method in Page Factory class. 
Using the initElements method, one can initialize all the android/ios elements 
located by @FindBy annotation.

This is the point we initiated the Page Factory. Here PageFactory is a 
class which is having a static method “public static <T> T initElements(WebDriver driver, Class<T> pageClassToProxy)” 
This method is used to initiate the driver instance of a given class and which will return an 
instantiated instance of the class with WebElement.

AppiumFieldDecorator() which is one of an overridden constructor of the class “AppiumFieldDecorator”. 
This constructor is used to decorate/initiate each mobile element directly as a “MobileElement” variable.

In combination of PageFactory.initElements and AppiumFieldDecorator we can initiate a variable/element 
with the help of @FindBy annotations.

Android - @AndroidFindBy(xpath, className, id, uiAutomator)
iOS - iOSFindBy(accessibilityId, xpath, className, id, predicate)

Remember, one of the main advantage using Page Factory is declaring locators/elements directly as 
a “MobileElement”. To do so it is important to initiate the driver as soon as the class is invoked 
This is one of a main reason why we are initiating page factory in Constructor.
